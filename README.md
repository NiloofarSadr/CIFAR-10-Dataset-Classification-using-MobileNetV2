# CIFAR-10-Dataset-Classification-using-MobileNetV2
MobileNetV2 architecture is introduced as a lightweight neural network architecture for object recognition applications in mobile phones. In this project, by using a pre-trained example of this architecture on the ImageNet dataset (which is ready-made in the tensorflow and pytorch programming frameworks), a model has been trained to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset.
